            <p>The practice of keeping a commonplace book is one that has been around for centuries – from Renaissance writers to 17th century students. Many have used this tradition to hold onto words that matter, and in that same spirit, my commonplace book is an ongoing record of my thoughts over time. </p>

I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.",

You feel embarrassed or you feel like, Damn, I wanted to be the winner. But winning doesn't always happen. It usually doesn't happen. So how do you live with that? And when you take the chance, it's still important that you took the leap and you went for it. Failures can be in not taking the chance. As you get older that's something that you start to feel.

All that mattered was if a song spoke to me and if it reflected all of the weird things that make up who I am as a fan and as a person. I entertained myself and got a lot off my chest.

A guy rushes up and says, \"Step aside.\" He looks over your loved one's bullet wound and pulls out a pocket knife -- he's going to operate right there in the street. You ask, \"Are you a doctor?\" The guy says, \"No.\" You say, \"But you know what you're doing, right? You're an old Army medic, or...\" At this point the guy becomes annoyed. He tells you that he is a nice guy, he is honest, he is always on time. He tells you that he is a great son to his mother and has a rich life full of fulfilling hobbies, and he boasts that he never uses foul language. Confused, you say, \"How does any of that matter when my loved one is lying here bleeding! I need somebody who knows how to operate on bullet wounds! Can you do that or not?!?\" Now the man becomes agitated -- why are you being shallow and selfish? Do you not care about any of his other good qualities? Didn't you just hear him say that he always remembers his girlfriend's birthday? In that panicked moment, you will take your bloody hands and shake him by the shoulders, screaming, \"Yes, I'm saying that none of that other shit matters, because in this specific situation, I just need somebody who knows how to stop the bleeding, you crazy fucking asshole.\" So here is my terrible truth about the adult world: You are in that very situation every single day. Only you are the confused guy with the pocket knife. All of society is the bleeding gunshot victim.",

Now I'm in my late 20s and feel as if someone pressed fast forward on my life.

What if you're attracted to the idea of making money and more attracted to some kinds of work than others, but neither attraction predominates? How do you break ties? The key here is to understand that such ties are only apparent. When you have trouble choosing between following your interests and making money, it's never because you have complete knowledge of yourself and of the types of work you're choosing between, and the options are perfectly balanced. When you can't decide which path to take, it's almost always due to ignorance. In fact you're usually suffering from three kinds of ignorance simultaneously: you don't know what makes you happy, what the various kinds of work are really like, or how well you could do them. In a way this ignorance is excusable. It's often hard to predict these things, and no one even tells you that you need to. If you're ambitious you're told you should go to college, and this is good advice so far as it goes, but that's where it usually ends. No one tells you how to figure out what to work on, or how hard this can be. What do you do in the face of uncertainty? Get more certainty. And probably the best way to do that is to try working on things you're interested in. That will get you more information about how interested you are in them, how good you are at them, and how much scope they offer for ambition. Don't wait. Don't wait till the end of college to figure out what to work on. Don't even wait for internships during college. You don't necessarily need a job doing x in order to work on x; often you can just start doing it in some form yourself. And since figuring out what to work on is a problem that could take years to solve, the sooner you start, the better.",

Adams, a professor of sociology and gerontology at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. This is why so many people meet their lifelong friends in college, she added.",
